Many of the textbooks my school uses come with quizzes and question banks created with ExamView Assessment Suite.  Since it's free, we deploy ExamView Player to all of our computers so students are able to easily take tests and other assessments without the need for making a paper copy. Just copy this batch file to the same directory as the ExamView installer downloaded from eInstruction's website, and run the batch file.
